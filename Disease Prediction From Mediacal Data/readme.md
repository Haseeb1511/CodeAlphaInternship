Here’s a **README.md** file for your **Heart Disease Prediction** project using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.  

---

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction  

This project builds a Heart Disease Prediction Model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest, deployed as a Streamlit Web App for easy user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.  
- **Data Visualization**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of various medical attributes used to predict heart disease risk. Some key features:  
- `age` – Age of the patient  
- `sex` – Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)  
- `cp` – Chest pain type (categorical)  
- `trestbps` – Resting blood pressure  
- `chol` – Serum cholesterol level  
- `fbs` – Fasting blood sugar (1 = High, 0 = Normal)  
- `thalach` – Maximum heart rate achieved  
- `target` – 0 (No Heart Disease) / 1 (Heart Disease)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy**: Measures how often the model is correct.  
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluates false positives and false negatives.  
- **Confusion Matrix**: A detailed classification performance measure.  

---

## 📊 Results  
| Model               | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 87.2%    |

---

## 🖼 Visualizations  
- Feature importance analysis  
- Confusion matrix for both models  

---

## 🖼 Web App Interface  
The **Streamlit app** allows users to input their medical details and get instant heart disease predictions.  
Key Features:  
✅ **User Input Form** for entering medical data  
✅ **Real-time Predictions** using ML models  
✅ **Visualizations** (Feature Importance, Model Performance)
